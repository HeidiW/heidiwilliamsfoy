I've been needing to create a new blog for a long time. I mostly hestitated because I wasn't sure where I wanted to start. Then, I came across a very helpful blog post from a former (very knowledgable) colleague that gave me some direction. 

This served as another small reminder of how much I miss the fabric of social life. The everyday discussions, the lunch chats and exchanges of trivia, even the snatches of overheard conversation that bring inspiration. 

One reason I want to start working again, aside from the obvious (money, career is currently dead in the water), is to once more join the stream of consciousness that exists outside of home life. Aside from purely social and familial ties, the randomness of companies, the initial strangers coming together, if even just on Zoom for now, is something irreplaceable. 

I have adapted a lot in the past several months but I don't want to adapt too much. Not to lockdown life. This, too, shall pass. Right?
